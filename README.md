# Ignited Local Deving Environment

This will be a boiler plate for full-time/contracted workers at Ignited Local can use to build out their client projects. The current process requires too much wasted time saving on our proprietary CMS, waiting for changes, reloading the test site, then finally seeing changes. I want to make the dev experience less tedious by incorporating React building since most of our contractors are coming from the Austin Coding Academy MERN stack. Using Create React App and React Snapshot for pre-rendering, the developers can build their site using CRAs JSX syntax then running the build script for React-Snapshot magic then copy and paste the rendered code into the CMS.
